## 11/1/2025 - Initial research!  

Ive got an overall idea on how a pet bottle recycler works, but never really looked into the details much. I think before starting the modelling, etc. itd be better to get some info for potential future struggles and so on.
All i know so far about the process is: bottle gets sliced into strips, pulled thru an extruder and then wound onto a spool. 
After watching a bunch of vids on ppl assembling pet recyclers (didnt really get as many about the design process itself, but thats my task after all, also [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yIe1Pp_Nrg) was the coolest one i found, will probably be using it as a reference mainly, even though it might not be fully printed like i want it), i got an approximate plan? I can slice the bottle with some sanded bearings (which i think is really cool, i only thought of using a blade b4), as for the heating part, im currently trying to deconstruct the kobra hotend. Also, i think ill try to make this thing as compact as possible, since i dont have much space in my room :pf:

Probably the inspo ill be using throughout the project:
