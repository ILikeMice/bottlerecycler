## 11/1/2025 3 PM - Initial research!  

Ive got an overall idea on how a pet bottle recycler works, but never really looked into the details much. I think before starting the modelling, etc. itd be better to get some info for potential future struggles and so on.
All i know so far about the process is: bottle gets sliced into strips, pulled thru an extruder and then wound onto a spool. 
After watching a bunch of vids on ppl assembling pet recyclers (didnt really get as many about the design process itself, but thats my task after all, also [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yIe1Pp_Nrg) was the coolest one i found, will probably be using it as a reference mainly, even though it might not be fully printed like i want it), i got an approximate plan? I can slice the bottle with some sanded bearings (which i think is really cool, i only thought of using a blade b4), as for the heating part, im currently trying to deconstruct the kobra hotend. Also, i think ill try to make this thing as compact as possible, since i dont have much space in my room :pf:

Probably the inspo ill be using throughout the project:

## 11/1/2025 9 PM - Hotend!

Managed to fully take apart the hotend, surprisingly without breaking anything (and did some browsing on aliexpress for the parts i dont yet have) ! Its got a pcb with some ressistors, but those seem to be for the levelling sensor, so im unsure whether ill use it or just detach all the things from it. 
After some more digging, i found out that the hotend runs at 24V, so ill need a 24V psu, but im willing to pay for all that stuff. The benefit of using the pcb though would be having every connection neatly mounted already, so on second thoughr ill try and stick with that, not like its got any other use. 
Also, while taking the thing apart, i noticed that the steppers casing is grounded for some reason (weird to me, but ill probs keep that just to be safe :p ) also would probably need to make some drilling changes for the hotend, either drill a slightly bigger intake hole with a stepless bit, or if i dont feel like drilling i might try making that transition with a 3d printed part (my own idea wow), and ill defo need to make a 1.7mm hole in the nozzle ive got already. 

Speaking again of the pcb, its got a weird mount for all the cables, but a simple jumper cable seems to fit it, but ill have to design some frame to hold them all so i can clamp them with the things at the mount. Would be cool to use though.  

## 11/2/2025 12 AM - more research yippie  

I know i need a 24V PSU, but i have no idea so far how strong it should be. since i want this to be as compact as possible, im hoping for 3A at best, 5A max. Above that the psu gets a bit big (3A is 110\*78\*36, 5A is 160\*98\*42mm, 6A is 199\*98\*42mm). After a quite some research i found that the hotend altogether is supposed to be about 24/60W, which is about 2.5A already. Also checked on the heating element itself (which gave me 60w) to confirm the power and the fact its the hotend only, not the whole toolhead with stepper and so on. I couldnt find anything googling the numbers on the stepper to get its approximate power, so i had to turn to deepseek my beloved. It suggested a max current of .66A per phase, so 1.32A max in total, so ill stick to that for now (writing on the nema17 was **_42shdb0066z-10WD_**). After detaching the small fan attached to the heatsink, i could read off 0.08A/24V from it. I could also use the bigger fan there, but itll need .2A of current, so i gotta see if ive got enough left at the end. So for now, the total current is at about **3.9A** (with the smaller fan, with the bigger one its **4.02A**). Id like some wiggle room for the controlling stuff (which i gotta power with a stepdown converter), so i think 5A should hopefully be enough. I dont need anything fancy to control the stepper, ill use a L298N driver that ive got laying around. Speaking of logic and control though, ill need something to actually control all the stuff. I could go with an orph pico ive got but that would mean id need a display, and i sadly dont have one right now (altho it would be cool to use one bc yk, this is a hc ysws). An alternative would be an ESP32/rpi zero 2 W that i gotta control via ssh or so, which would save me like 3 bucks in buttons and display. tempting. Although a display would look cooler.

## 11/2/2025 3 PM - CAD start  

After trying around a bit in freecad and taking 8 fucking minutes to make a single rectangle, i decided that i dont like freecad anymore and am switching to onshape. I did some irl mockups of how the hotend and so on could be placed, and the two options i had was either with the fan facing downwards, but pcb being below the hotend, or fan upwards and pcb being higher than the hotend, since i cant really move it much due to the cables. I tried reattaching the fan on the other side of the heatsink so it could be on top with the pcb on the bottom, but had to kinda force the screw into it from the other side to make the thread useable, no idea why they made it like that. 
Anyways, after doing that, the layout of the components seems perfectly useable, i need the hotend to be higher than the pcb because i gotta get it as far away from the plasic parts as possible, while preferrably having the pcb inside the casing. I made an approximate model of the whole hotend part in onshape, with the main details ill need for mounting, etc. Took a bit longer than estimated, since i had to get used to onshape, but overall onshape seems pretty nice.

## 11/2/2025 9 PM - More CAD!  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg4OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--731f5913e94ee7d04401f6152c0f8386608c5581/image.png)

Thought of how id design the casing.[ In the video i mentioned in the first devlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yIe1Pp_Nrg), the guy was using extrusions and kinda just mounting everything on that. As cool as i thought having extrusions would be, i wanna make this as 3d printable and cheap as possible. My current idea is to have little platforms or pins to hold the psu and so on, that ill screw into the sides of the rectangular ish casing (without a bottom, to reduce material), still thinking on that though. 

Either way, main thing this session was cadding the pcb so i can make a mount for it or so. That took me waaaayyy too long since there wasnt ANY info on it online, so i had to measure anything manually (and of course i fucked up a couple times, and had constraint errors everywhere T-T, also i realized ive never really modelled after a real life complex-ish object without a schematic). After fixing everything though, it looks pretty nice and im happy with it. I wanna also make mounts ish for every pcb ill have, since this thing might be moved around a bunch and i wouldnt want the stuff to slip.  

## 11/3/2025 - Casing stuff!

^^As you can see above, i did a bunch of improvements on the casing! Taking inspo from the design of that other guy i mentioned in the first entry, i wanted some sort of hex pattern on the casing, which looks cool but is also mainly to save some filament and printing time. Ive never really printed anything vertically with a hex pattern, and was unsure if it would hold at all. Some research told me i gotta have the flat side of the hexagon pointing up, and just bridge over it so it doesnt break. I have no idea how my printer performs in bridging, but from what ive seen online the quality is pretty meh, but using supports might just increase print  time and filament use more than this pattern is reducing. The upper version is me trying to round the corners to minimize bridging, but that way just leads to circles at the end, and im unsure of what the layer height req will be with rounded corners (does also look pretty cool tho!). Gotta run some tests ig.

Also, i got started on the electronics layout stuff and so on! Added some cool looking holders! The orange ones will be secured in place with the 2 heatset inserts and some screws ive got in the hotend/some other way, but ill be sure to definetly use those inserts, thought its really neat to use as much from the toolhead as possible. The blue ones are printed together with the case (i thought of making them flipped, so i wouldnt need support but that seemed like a pretty bad idea holding power wise) and are gonna need supports, so i placed them on the edges to be able to not have supports placed on the model itself.

PS: this shit took me way too long, im not adding all the variations i tried here and holy some of the tools (esp pattern) are so much weirder than in fusion, this shit is making me actually learn how to use constrains in sketches lmao
  

## 11/4/2025 - Electronics layout stuff (yay..)  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODM1NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ac5a3424307e4ceb28e3a53fa573dd07601c3bef/image.png)

I did some of the work here yesterday, but was too tired to document it :p

First of all, made holes for screws/heatset inserts to mount the pcb and hotend (also made a hole for the pcb wire holder thing so i can connect stuff from the electronics inside the case into it)! Had to correct some little errors in the pcb model since im that good at cad. Also, minor change, changed the shape of the electonics holder mount, since printing circles would be pretty annoying and probs unstable.

Really love how i can modify the timeline to change some stuff, didnt really do that much in fusion, does take some extra time sometimes tho, but feels waaay cleaner

So, electronics layout! Dont wanna flood the whole page with the shit i tried before giving up and looking for an algorithm to find the optimal layout for me (almost pulled up python smh), the first img is one of the first things i tried making and was confident enough in to screenshot! I was then hit by the psu that i hid which was taking up too much of the space. My fault for hoping i could fit all the stuff on 1 platform ig. I was still hanging onto the idea of fitting it all on the platform for a while, all i needed was like 3mm of extra space. I then proceeded to resize the whole case (which was really painful since i also had to change the pattern thing) only to realize that its 223mm long now. Which just so happens to be about 3mm bigger than my printbed. Yeouch. The whole thing is like 110mm wide so i dont think placing it diagonally would fit it onto the printbed either. Started thinking of where i could possibly place 1 more component, first idea was to make the platform have 2 floors, but that seemed rly hard to print and overall i am not dealing with the wires on 2 whole floors. Other option would be to mount it somewhere on the case (if so, then probably on the "ceiling" of the case, since anywhere else would be too far from the components (e.g. i need the 24 to 5v converter to be not far from the esp in order to power it, and other components like the mosfet or L298N near the PSU cuz i need 24v there). After more pondering and messing around for a fuckton of time, i went with the L298N on the ceiling, and the rest on the Platform (dont have mounting holes for the components figured out yet, will after most of them arrive)  

## 11/6/2025 - Filament spool mount!  

Yippie 2 in 1 journal entry again! 
Final design today below:

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTAxNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e2539befcb8ef90f939dccb3f2cf3b38b72ab463/image.png)

Yesterday, i made the side things that are supposed to hold the spool up, see how theres like half the thing popping out at the bottom? I probably couldve just not done that but i wanted to make sure this shit does NOT wiggle, and even tho inserting a bolt from that side makes the main case look weird in places, i think its probs def better with that side mount (i still gotta add a screw to hold it down like one normally would). 

Initially, the plan for the spool was for it to be halfway "inside" the case, kinda submerged for compactness. Only reason i cant do that though is thanks to the electronics layout problem (not reexplaining that, go read previous entries) taking up way too much space, and removing any more of the case would just screw up the stability of it.

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTAxNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a4835545d9f855be9ec5c5137eb9db1cab1c87a7/image.png)

^^weird case thing because of the sideways screw, hopefully it wont break (surely not foreshadowing, _**right**_?)^^

Then today, i also did some more research on how people overall made this part. Once again taking inspo from the main inspiration design, i saw hes got a 3d printed spool and a huuuge gear around it connected to a smaller stepper gear. As much as i want to make this fully 3d printable, i did have a spool with just a bit of filament left int it. After removing that, i saved myself like 6-7 hours of print time! The spool has round holes in it, 6 in total, paired together in 3 pairs. My initial idea was to make things that clamp into those, holding a gear that i can later rotate somehow. I ended up thinking about that in the very last step, will return to this in like 1 paragraph.

I was now also stuck with a decision: either i connect the spool with a timing belt (my initial idea) or i make a huge gear thats exactly the same module as the one mounted on the stepper (cant take off the gear sadly, its part of the stepper rod :p). The timing belt did fit onto the stepper gear decently though, and that extra closed loop belt i bought was reeeealllly looking at me. biggest gear i could do with that belt was about 80T though, and the stepper ended up being way too far from the pcb :/ I didnt really want to do a big gear, since first of all, id have to print a decently big chunk of it with the smallest nozzle ive got (0.2mm), and prototyping didnt sound much fun with that either. After trying around some more though, i realized i didnt really have a choice, so i just went with that, and make a whopping 400T gear (it had to be big enough to read anywhere near the PCB) that made onshape lag yayyy! Also, decided to mount the stepper directly to one of the spool holders, since i dont think i really need a stepper frame here. I did have to manually measure everything on the stepper tho since i dont trust online sources on some random stepper that i dont have a 20823 page manual for. In total, i am left with a 40:1 reduction ratio on that thing, surely thats fine.

Back to attaching the gear to the spool! I tried using those 6 holes, but they were so conveniently placed for my inconvenience, that the teeth were right in the middle of them. Instead of trying to get it to work i just switched to the 3 rectangular ish holes on the spool. My idea of having the mounts outside the gear didnt really work with that one, i think its even better this way though, lucky the 1st version didnt work! 

The blue thing is the thing that attaches to the filament spool. Ill print it with a bigger nozzle to save time and just glue it onto the gear thing.

Biggest problem so far though was the layout of the stuff on that cylinder thats holding everything. i wanted to make everything not slip, and make sure the rod itself is somewhat detachable too, since ill need to remove the spool for, you know, printing sometime. Long story short, in the end i ended up with a design looking like a spyglass, where the things have a decreasing diameter, so theyre practically locked in place/sqished into the one holder!

Also, the spool isnt perfectly centered now, so i had to move the hotend a bit.
