## 11/1/2025 3 PM - Initial research!  

Ive got an overall idea on how a pet bottle recycler works, but never really looked into the details much. I think before starting the modelling, etc. itd be better to get some info for potential future struggles and so on.
All i know so far about the process is: bottle gets sliced into strips, pulled thru an extruder and then wound onto a spool. 
After watching a bunch of vids on ppl assembling pet recyclers (didnt really get as many about the design process itself, but thats my task after all, also [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yIe1Pp_Nrg) was the coolest one i found, will probably be using it as a reference mainly, even though it might not be fully printed like i want it), i got an approximate plan? I can slice the bottle with some sanded bearings (which i think is really cool, i only thought of using a blade b4), as for the heating part, im currently trying to deconstruct the kobra hotend. Also, i think ill try to make this thing as compact as possible, since i dont have much space in my room :pf:

Probably the inspo ill be using throughout the project:

## 11/1/2025 9 PM - Hotend!

Managed to fully take apart the hotend, surprisingly without breaking anything (and did some browsing on aliexpress for the parts i dont yet have) ! Its got a pcb with some ressistors, but those seem to be for the levelling sensor, so im unsure whether ill use it or just detach all the things from it. 
After some more digging, i found out that the hotend runs at 24V, so ill need a 24V psu, but im willing to pay for all that stuff. The benefit of using the pcb though would be having every connection neatly mounted already, so on second thoughr ill try and stick with that, not like its got any other use. 
Also, while taking the thing apart, i noticed that the steppers casing is grounded for some reason (weird to me, but ill probs keep that just to be safe :p ) also would probably need to make some drilling changes for the hotend, either drill a slightly bigger intake hole with a stepless bit, or if i dont feel like drilling i might try making that transition with a 3d printed part (my own idea wow), and ill defo need to make a 1.7mm hole in the nozzle ive got already. 

Speaking again of the pcb, its got a weird mount for all the cables, but a simple jumper cable seems to fit it, but ill have to design some frame to hold them all so i can clamp them with the things at the mount. Would be cool to use though.  

## 11/2/2025 12 AM - more research yippie  

I know i need a 24V PSU, but i have no idea so far how strong it should be. since i want this to be as compact as possible, im hoping for 3A at best, 5A max. Above that the psu gets a bit big (3A is 110\*78\*36, 5A is 160\*98\*42mm, 6A is 199\*98\*42mm). After a quite some research i found that the hotend altogether is supposed to be about 24/60W, which is about 2.5A already. Also checked on the heating element itself (which gave me 60w) to confirm the power and the fact its the hotend only, not the whole toolhead with stepper and so on. I couldnt find anything googling the numbers on the stepper to get its approximate power, so i had to turn to deepseek my beloved. It suggested a max current of .66A per phase, so 1.32A max in total, so ill stick to that for now (writing on the nema17 was **_42shdb0066z-10WD_**). After detaching the small fan attached to the heatsink, i could read off 0.08A/24V from it. I could also use the bigger fan there, but itll need .2A of current, so i gotta see if ive got enough left at the end. So for now, the total current is at about **3.9A** (with the smaller fan, with the bigger one its **4.02A**). Id like some wiggle room for the controlling stuff (which i gotta power with a stepdown converter), so i think 5A should hopefully be enough. I dont need anything fancy to control the stepper, ill use a L298N driver that ive got laying around. Speaking of logic and control though, ill need something to actually control all the stuff. I could go with an orph pico ive got but that would mean id need a display, and i sadly dont have one right now (altho it would be cool to use one bc yk, this is a hc ysws). An alternative would be an ESP32/rpi zero 2 W that i gotta control via ssh or so, which would save me like 3 bucks in buttons and display. tempting. Although a display would look cooler.

## 11/2/2025 3 PM - CAD start  

After trying around a bit in freecad and taking 8 fucking minutes to make a single rectangle, i decided that i dont like freecad anymore and am switching to onshape. I did some irl mockups of how the hotend and so on could be placed, and the two options i had was either with the fan facing downwards, but pcb being below the hotend, or fan upwards and pcb being higher than the hotend, since i cant really move it much due to the cables. I tried reattaching the fan on the other side of the heatsink so it could be on top with the pcb on the bottom, but had to kinda force the screw into it from the other side to make the thread useable, no idea why they made it like that. 
Anyways, after doing that, the layout of the components seems perfectly useable, i need the hotend to be higher than the pcb because i gotta get it as far away from the plasic parts as possible, while preferrably having the pcb inside the casing. I made an approximate model of the whole hotend part in onshape, with the main details ill need for mounting, etc. Took a bit longer than estimated, since i had to get used to onshape, but overall onshape seems pretty nice.

## 11/2/2025 9 PM - More CAD!

Thought of how id design the casing.[ In the video i mentioned in the first devlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yIe1Pp_Nrg), the guy was using extrusions and kinda just mounting everything on that. As cool as i thought having extrusions would be, i wanna make this as 3d printable and cheap as possible. My current idea is to have little platforms or pins to hold the psu and so on, that ill screw into the sides of the rectangular ish casing (without a bottom, to reduce material), still thinking on that though. 

Either way, main thing this session was cadding the pcb so i can make a mount for it or so. That took me waaaayyy too long since there wasnt ANY info on it online, so i had to measure anything manually (and of course i fucked up a couple times, and had constraint errors everywhere T-T, also i realized ive never really modelled after a real life complex-ish object without a schematic). After fixing everything though, it looks pretty nice and im happy with it. I wanna also make mounts ish for every pcb ill have, since this thing might be moved around a bunch and i wouldnt want the stuff to slip.
